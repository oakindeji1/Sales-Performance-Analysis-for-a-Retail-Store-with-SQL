# Sales-Performance-Analysis-for-a-Retail-Store-with-SQL
 In this project, I was tasked with analyzing the sales performance of a retail store using SQL.  I need to explore sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional  performance, and monthly sales trends.

## I imported the dataset into my SQL Server environment to wrote and validated my queries. 
### My queries is to extract key insights based on the following questions.  
- retrieve the total sales for each product category. 
- find the number of sales transactions in each region. 
- find the highest-selling product by total sales value. 
- calculate total revenue per product. 
- calculate monthly sales totals for the current year. 
- find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount. 
- calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region. 
- identify products with no sales in the last quarter.
